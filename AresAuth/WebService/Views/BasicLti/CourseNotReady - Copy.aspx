						<p>	<h3>Instructors:</h3> An E-Reserve system is being acquired that
will allow instructors to request both Library E-Reserves and
Audio Reserves through this page at some point this summer.  Be on
the lookout for more information from the Library.
</p>

<p> <h3> Students: </h3>If your instructor has requested E-Reserves
and/or Audio Reserves, this is where you will find them, no sooner
than two weeks prior to the start of the semester.  If there are
no reserves here, it may mean they haven't been requested and
processed yet, or that your course is not using them.
